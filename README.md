# Data Science Curriculum

## Juan Antonio Morales - Data Scientist in the making

### Summary and objectives:

The goal of this master is to learn the whole Data Science cycle: since the raw data, to the building of dashboard, through machine learning and the application of statistical methods in the resolution of common Data Science problems.<br />

At the end of the master's degree the student will be able to convert data into products and services by using the most common statistical methods in the field of Data Science, as well as write their own code to analyze huge amount of data and apply machine learning techniques to this data using Spark.<br />
